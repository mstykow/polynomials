# Implementation of Polynomials

This is an object-oriented programming exercise in which a class 'polynomial' is created on which several methods can be performed. Also included is a unit test file which was used to spot and eliminate possible bugs during programming.

The exercise comes from [http://www.home.hs-karlsruhe.de/~pach0003/informatik_1/aufgaben/objekt_orientierung.html#polynom](http://www.home.hs-karlsruhe.de/~pach0003/informatik_1/aufgaben/objekt_orientierung.html#polynom).
